- 1. Process scrapped data that I stored in juptrynotebook
- 2. Fix Typosquatting Algo appoarch
- 3. Analysis which tags are most and least popular and give a rating to each extension (minimize the computational cost of analysisng the meta data)
- 4. Consine similairty between extension description

- 6. If all goes well, potentially start adding more features if requested by prof
